1. My project is a "About Me" website, or an unofficial porfolio! I can showcase a bunch of my work, art pieces, etc. and people can learn about me from this website! It is called Sophia's Showcase.
2. I made my project because I wanted to showcase and display my works. Its a fun little thing I can add onto once in a while, and I'm able to see my progress in my work over the years.
3. I made my project using html, css, and java. I used css to change the size of the items, change the position of the text, drawings, and create animations for the landing page. I used java to implement fun music into one of my pages, as well as a cute transition between my pages.
4. I struggled a lot of the responsive aspect and the animating. It was very time consuming and I had to watch a lot of videos to learn how to animate.
